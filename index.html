    <h2>Momostenango, Guatemala</h2>
    <p>Momostenango is a town in the department of Totonicapan in Guatemala. When I lived in Momostenango, I was exposed to different foods and cultural practices.
       One of my favorite foods I had while living there was pan mojado (wet bread) with atol blanco (a white hot cornmeal drink).
      Pan mojado and atol blanco are prepared and consumed during holy week (Semana Santa).</p>
      <p> What makes pan mojado special is the syrup that is poured over the baked bread.The syrup is made up of lime leaves, cinnamon, anis, 
        white and black panela (a raw sugar with a rich caramel-like flavor). The bread itself can be bought at the local bakeries. The atol blanco is 
        made up of cornmeal and a fusion of cacoa and sapodilla seeds. It isn't a sweet drink, so its flavors balance out the sweetness from the pan mojado.
      </p> 
      <p>During Semana Santa, you see people of the community stopping by homes of their neighbors, friends and family to give them pan mojado with atol blanco. One exchange could last
        could last for hours, depending on who you were visiting, because this custom encourages people to spend time together and catch up on family news and community gossip. 
        My host family explained that for many people, Semana Santa is used to reflect on their sins, ask for forgiveness and give to those in need. A way the community would give those
        in need was through gifting pan mojado and atol blanco.</p>
        <p> The message surrounding pan mojado and atol blanco is community and family unity. It's a wonderful piece of food culture 
        nestled in the celebration of Semana Santa that makes the whole experience all the more meaningful.</p>

    <h2>Barcelona, Spain</h2>
    <p>I have been living in Barcelona for over a year and an alcoholic drink I have been learning about is vermouth.
      Vermouth is a white wine that is infused with spices like cardamom, cinnamon and cloves. It is left to age in barrels 
      and with time develops a dark, rich color. Vermouth is usually served with a cube of ice and an orange wedge. 
      It's an aromatic cold drink with a semi-sweet flavor, almost like a mulled-wine.</p>
      <p>
      Vermouth is unique because it is not only a noun, but a verb. To drink vermouth is one thing, but to go vermouthing is something different.
      The act of vermouthing involves going out with friends and/or family to a bar or cafe on a Sunday afternoon and ordering vermouth with savory side dishes. 
      The types of savory side dishes can vary, but the most common I have expereinced are olives, vineger chips and anchovies. 
    </p>
    <p>Vermouthing is a social experience that has been resurging in popularity, especially amoung younger people. Traditionally, vermouth was considered an old man's drink that was drinken 
      before or after Sunday church service. While not everyone attends Sunday church services, the tradition of vermouthing still continues amoung young and old alike.
    This tradition has been enjoyable to particpate in because brings friends and family together outside of their homes to relax before the busy work week begins. </p>
